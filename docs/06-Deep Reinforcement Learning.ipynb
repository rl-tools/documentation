    "In this chapter we use the previously demonstrated deep learning capabilities of **BackpropTools** in combination with a (inverted) pendulum simulator that is equivalent to the `Pendulum-v1` in [gym/gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) to train a swing-up control policy. For the training, we use the [TD3](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/fujimoto18a) off-policy, deep-RL algorithm. TD3 and required supporting data structures and algorithms are integrated in **BackpropTools**. \n",

    "Note that the training time in the animation refers to bare metal training, not using the Cling interpreter like these notebooks do. As you can see from the training later on even when dispatching to a BLAS library, Cling is much slower than optimized, bare-metal code. See the repository [https://github.com/BackpropTools/BackpropTools](https://github.com/BackpropTools/BackpropTools) for more information on how to run the training directly on your hardware. You can also try the [WASM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) based training in your browser at [https://backprop.tools](https://backprop.tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, as beforehand we include the necessary primitive operations (dispatching matrix multiplications to OpenBLAS). We also use the neural network operations (dense layer forward and backward pass) that take advantage of OpenBLAS through `the nn/operations_cpu_mux.h` multiplexer. The accelerated forward and backward pass are automatically used if the higher level operations (forward/backward pass on the full model) are called with the OpenBLAS device (coming from the `DEVICE_FACTORY`). To make the accelerated routines available to the higher-level functions, `nn_models/operations_cpu.h` has to be included after `nn/operations_cpu_mux.h`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pendulum environment is implemented in pure C++ without dependencies, hence it contains only generic operations and can be included by the collective `rl/environments/operations_generic.h` that includes all generic functions of all available environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "For TD3 and all its related data structures and algorithms we just need to include `rl/operations_generic.h` because all the operations are higher-level and dispatch to the lower-level primitives imported beforehand. The RL operations call functions to interact with the environment as well as perform forward and backward passes on the neural network model which in turn calls the dense layer operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we include the `rl/utils/evaluation.h` header so that we easily execute deterministic rollouts (without exploration noise) and get average rewards in fixed intervals to monitor the training progress."

    "In the following these hyperparameters are used to set up the actor and critic types and combine them into a combined actor-critic type that is used in the TD3 implementation. Furthermore, we are defining an off-policy runner type that contains a replay buffer and interacts with the environment. Initially, we were hiding this complexity in the actor critic structure but we found that exposing it is beneficial because the user has more agency and can swap out parts more easily. For example the actor and critic network types can be any type for which a `bpt::forward` and `bpt::backward` operation exist (these functions should be included before the RL operations like described above)."

    "Now we can finally train the pendulum swing up. We iterate over `STEP_LIMIT` steps. Every `1000` steps we evaluate the averate return of the current policy (using deterministic rollouts without exploration noise). On every iteration we call `bpt::step` which uses the off-policy runner to execute one step using the current policy and save it in its internal replay buffer. After some warmup steps we can start training the actor and critic models. To train the critic, we sample target action noise (such that the training itself is deterministic), sample a batch from the replay buffer and train the critic. This is done for each critic individually. On every other step we use the current target critic to train the actor using another batch sampled from the replay buffer. We also update the target critics and actor on every other step.
