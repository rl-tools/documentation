    "In many real-world scenarios we do not have access to the ground truth state of the environment. In these cases we only get observations that have some mutual information with the true state. In this case the Markov property is violated because we are dealing with a  [POMDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_Markov_decision_process) and hence information from past observations influences the estimate of the current state. Because the belief about the current state is dependent on previous observations, also the future behavior and action selection decision are dependent on them.\n",

    "To respect this in our policy, it needs to be able to reason about sequences of observations. A natural way to implement this is using recurrent neural networs (RNNs) that carry an internal state that can transport information through time. Starting from RLtools v2.1 this sequential nature is supported for off-policy algorithms (SAC and TD3, supported by the `OffPolicyRunner`). PPO does not support sequences, yet. \n",

    "Off-policy RL algorithms like SAC and TD3 use a target critic to bootstrap next-state values. These estimated next-state values are used in combination with the Bellman equation to improve the critic/value function. In the Markovian case, where each value estimate only depends on the current state this is relatively straightforward but in the partially observable case it becomes more nuanced as can be seen in the following illustration:\n",

    "\n",
    "When sampling sequences from the replay buffer we need to consider the properties of the environment. For example some environments only reveal some information on the first step, which the agent is supposed to memorize and use to make control decisions later in the episode. In these cases it does not make sense to sample partial episodes because the initial information is missing and the control problem might be ill-posed without it. To control this behavior we expose the  `ALWAYS_SAMPLE_FROM_INITIAL_STATE` flag. Moreover the sequence lengths the policy (and critic) is exposed to during training matters. Sequence length extrapolation (aka using the policy on longer sequences during inference than during training) works in many cases it is still out of distribution. Hence we provide a flag `RANDOM_SEQ_LENGTH` to sample random sequence length (uniform distribution in sequence length). When sampling random sequence length uniformly it might be very rare to sample nominal/full length sequence. While training on random smaller sequence lengths can speed up training in some tasks we would like to perform inference/deployment at the fixed/nominal sequence length (or even extrapolate this) hence we enable a mixture distribution that switches between the uniform sequence length sampling and full sequence sampling by activating the `ENABLE_NOMINAL_SEQUENCE_LENGTH_PROBABILITY` flag and providing a mixture probability in `NOMINAL_SEQUENCE_LENGTH_PROBABILITY`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where information is only revealed on the first step, we run into a very nuanced issue where if we use the same sequence length for the critic and target critic, we miss the initial step in the target critic (as illustrated with the red part above). Hence, inferring the target values might be ill-posed. To account for this, we provide the `INCLUDE_FIRST_STEP_IN_TARGETS` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore there is also one nuance with the training of the actor. In most environments (except some theoretical/pathological examples), the actions impact the state. Hence, when considering trajectories, we can not modify intermediate actions as this invalidates the following states. This leads to the issue shown in the following illustration:\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we can only modify the final action of a sequence to feed that into the critic and backpropagate through the critic to improve the final action. All other actions in the sequence remain the same. This also means that the past actions that the policy sees can be very off-policy and to the best of our knowledge it remains an open research question how this influences the training dynamics. The masking of previous actions (killing the gradient signal) is controlled using the `MASK_NON_TERMINAL` flag which should be turned on for most environments:"
